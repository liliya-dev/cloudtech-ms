      Ulysses, Ulysses — Soaring through all the galaxies. In search of Earth, flying
      in to the night. Ulysses, Ulysses — Fighting evil and tyranny, with all his
      power, and with all of his might. Ulysses — no-one else can do the things you
      do. Ulysses — like a bolt of thunder from the blue. Ulysses — always fighting
      all the evil forces bringing peace and justice to all.
